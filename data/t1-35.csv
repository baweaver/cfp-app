Whenever I used apps on my mom's phone, I would always wonder how they were created.

I self-taught myself programming through online tutorials, and before I knew it, I released my first app on the App Store when I was 12. I‚Äôve worked with several companies to help make apps for them, as well as worked in specialized iOS development teams at startups to learn enterprise-level skills.

Afterward, I went to school for architecture, but after five years of getting my B.S. and working in the field, I realized it wasn't for me. I eventually found programming through a friend. I graduated from a bootcamp in Omaha, Nebraska in April of 2016. My first job out of the program was at a startup with little mentorship, questionable coding standards, and no other women. It was a frustrating experience where I doubted my decision to become a programmer on an almost daily basis. In Fall of 2018, I moved to San Francisco with quite a few gaps in my knowledge base, but was lucky enough to get an apprenticeship position at thoughtbot, where I was able to fill in those holes and really get a handle on how to use best practices on the job.",Employed as a full-time developer for 1-3 years,,In-person bootcamp,,Art/Creative Coding,"My talk is ultimately about failing many, many times","T2: Cats, The Musical! Algorithmic Song Meow-ification","Code samples,Demo of working code",,"How are you supposed to sing along with your favorite TV theme song every week if it doesn't have lyrics? At my house, we ""meow"" along (loudly). We also code, so I built 'Meowifier' to convert any song into a cat's meows. Join me in this exploration of melody analysis APIs and gratuitous cat gifs.
I built an application that takes a song's audio and outputs a new audio file with that song's melody **sung by cats**. It's a technical feat. It's hilarious. It's beautiful. It's a new way to waste time on the internet.

This talk walks through how _Meowifier_ was built, focusing on three aspects of the build that you might be surprised to learn were unique challenges.

**1. Finding a way to obtain the notes of  _only_ the melody from a song's audio file**
No bass line or harmony muddying things, please. The melody is the principal part of a song. If you were listening to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by _Queen_, the melody would be the part Freddy Mercury is singing. If you were to include the harmonies and bass parts in the meow-ified version, you wouldn't even recognize the resulting song because it would all sound jumbled together. Finding an API for song analysis and melody-extraction was surprisingly difficult. 

**2. Correcting your meow length to match the length of the note in the melody**
A melody is going to have notes of varying lengths. When you think back to 'Bohemian Rhapsody', Freddy doesn't hold each note for 0.5 seconds each. Some of them are .25 seconds or 0.125 seconds or even 1.5 seconds. But I can't have a meow folder containing meow files of every conceivable length. That would be a bloated monster of a library. Instead, I had to find a tool that could either cut or extend a meow to fill the proper amount of time.

**3. Creating a multi-octave library of meows**
That's a lot of meows, and if you hadn't noticed, very few cats meow in the tenor, baritone, or bass ranges. And where does one hire a cat choir to begin with? So I had to make my own custom meow library using some interesting tactics. (If you're imagining me meowing into a microphone with a tuner in hand, for each imaginable meow note, you're not far off!)","What do you do when your idea/app/life feels like a failure? How do you pick yourself up and keep going? Why is making a third-party API the core of your app a bad idea?
","Conferences are great, but there's only so much information you can digest at a time. At my talk, you'll get a light-hearted break where you can laugh a bit and learn a bit. And maybe you'll get the motivation you need to move forward with your own frivolous side project idea. Also, pictures of my cats.","That it's okay to make mistakes. A lot of mistakes even. If I can get up in front of hundreds of people all over the world and talk about my very unsuccessful attempt at a side project, you can too!",I'm talking about my experience building a side project with lofty expectations. No resources necessary!,"I've been able to combine two things I love with this talk -- programming and entertaining people. I've given this a longer version of this talk about a dozen times all over the world. I feel like it's especially relevant to this conference because I wrote my app only six months into my career as a software engineer and I get a lot of joy out of showing new devs that no one starts out getting it right all the time.
","I've given numerous talks at events like [RubyConf AU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTNPLwqJIDg), [Full Stack Fest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAiT2cBvl5w), [RubyConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0h5dzEFclY), [Keep Ruby Weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67OuTeRHmu4), [NEJS CONF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRJY_vJopv8), [TEDx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7VPDhbjOEA), Southeast Ruby, Frontmania, Barcamp Omaha, Emerging Developers Meetup, Omaha Ruby Meetup, etc.

Dev bad ass - FULL-STACK JavaScript Engineer
Most people call what I want to do a dev evangelist but I‚Äôm far from angelic
I can code but I don‚Äôt wanna
Used to be offended by the word layman and still sort of am
Even if it‚Äôs not deliberately mean still rude because I still consider myself layman because I don‚Äôt understand every concept and no one understands every language so to someone you‚Äôre a layman too
Also it has the word man so at the very least it should be lay person or lay individual
I used to think you had to be a really smart math wizard to be a software engineer and not to say it‚Äôs easy but it‚Äôs simple if you change your mind set and just have the discipline to move forward (and take breaks, pomodoro techniques a game changer) Some of the stuff I learned two months ago just started to make sense today because I have better context around it
It‚Äôs ok to be shy as an engineer. Half of the things you‚Äôre insecure about, everyone else is insecure about too or has been insecure about in their coding journey. The community is generally very supportive even if there are a few rotten apples
I didn‚Äôt initially tell people I was applying to techtonica because I didn‚Äôt want to not get in and then they‚Äôd ask if I got the opportunity and I‚Äôd be like no but once I did get the opportunity and started telling people, even people I‚Äôd consider friends they were very hesitant and even if they weren‚Äôt deliberately trying to be rude they were very hesitant to this new information and questioned my sincerity and my technical and logical abilities and it psyched me out and kind of put a fire under my butt (the haters are my motivators) because they were tapping into my own insecurities about entering this field. it‚Äôs important to note that all these people were men (aleru, narv, eld, ven) the two who actually knew JS, after their initial yet very apparent reluctancy did ofer to help if I needed it 
Even before I knew what a dev advocate or tech writer was and didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do as an engineer (full stack, front end, back end, QA, iOS, etc) people were already telling me ‚Äúwell maybe you can just work for techtonica after the program well maybe you can just help develop the program)
I appreciate you acknowledging my soft skills but BTFU
(This presentation just might be a passive aggressive fuck you) All in all be mindful of your tongue because you don‚Äôt know how what you say will actually affect a person even if they don‚Äôt give you an initial reaction ( I came up with the idea for this presentation at 4 am after waking up in the middle of my slumber because something was heavy on my heart and wrote the initial outline for an hour and a half)
I want to advocate for people like me who aren‚Äôt traditional but still very capable
I want to help motivate people who aren‚Äôt self taught, who had no prior interest but took a crack at it become successful",Lack of diversity in tech and imposter's syndrome.,I want them to leave knowing that even though learning to code is challenging and the industry hasn't been open to change that they will be apart of the gentrification of tech ;-),I want them to feel empowered and that they feel they belong in any tech space!,"https://www.kaporcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/KC18001_report_v6.pdf

Beginning:
 A. Quick intro & why I am a good fit to be giving this talk (please see FIT section)
 B. Agenda

II. Middle: Job Search Process
  A. Pre-search checklist & ongoing processes
      - Update resume, confirm references, make profiles on helpful job search 
       sites
     - Track your applications. Network. Whiteboard practice.
     - Make profiles on job search sites (list the most helpful ones)
  B. Application Process: Tips & Best Practices for Each Stage
   1. Initial application stage: It's a numbers game, put your pre-existing ideas 
     on the backburner, ignore qualifications requirements to an extent
   2. Phone screens: Recruiter screen/non-technical chat vs technical phone 
     screen - what to expect and how to prepare (what should you talk about? if 
     technical, how should you set up? what kind of questions usually get 
     asked?)
   3. In-person interviews - what to expect and how to prepare (How long are 
   they? What usually gets asked? How do you not freak out and have a 
   meltdown?)
  4. Offers - tips for negotiating your offer and what to keep in mind 
   (everyone's ideal offer is not the same, so consider carefully whats 
   important to you, also consider the whole benefits package/company 
    attributes, not just base salary)

III. End: Why is this so emotionally difficult, and strategies to deal with it:
  A. It's hard because:
     1. Deadlines, both real and somewhat imaginary - real if there's a financial 
     deadline, but if finishing bootcamp/program, you may have decided if you 
     don't have offer by end of it, you haven't met a ""deadline""
     2. Future being unknown causes anxiety
    3. Rejections suck and happen frequently
 B. What to keep in mind to fight the urge to just curl up in a ball & quit:
   1. Don't isolate yourself from your community. Buddy up with someone in 
   your bootcamp class to share experiences and pass job listings to each 
   other. If you're self-taught, try online communities and local meetups.
   2. Rejections suck but they are not a waste of time. Every single step of the 
    application process gets a little easier every time you do it. 
  3. Take breaks from studying and applying. Just make sure you come back to 
   it","While it's true that there's currently a shortage of devs to fill a huge number of available tech roles, popular rhetoric and many for-profit bootcamps have spun the idea that once someone completes a few months of learning to code, companies will be lining up at their door to employ them. The reality is that getting your first dev job, especially with a non-traditional background, can be really difficult, and this comes as a surprise to many newly trained devs. I know it surprised me. This talk aims to address the realities of how hard job search can be while also providing specific and actionable steps for increasing the chances you'll land your first dev job sooner rather than later (or never).","Understand that getting their first dev job is hard, but walk away with specific steps they can take in order to be successful at it.","The ones freaked out about job search - a little bit of relief that they have specific steps they can take to make the process easier.

People who assumed they'd have companies banging on their door - oh oops I guess this won't be a cake walk, I guess I'd better get started

Both groups - that it's hard, and initial rejection is normal, but that doesn't mean learning to code was a mistake and that you shouldn't pursue it.","This talk is adapted from one that I give at the bootcamp I graduated from. There, we provide data around my graduating class and employment rates, but if I give this talk at Codeland, I would do additional research around what's available for companies that employ non-CS-degree devs as well as employment rates for bootcamps in general.","I am extremely fortunate that I was accepted into a coding program that comes with a 5-month internship and has a great reputation in the Seattle tech community. Many of my classmates acquired their first jobs by receiving a full-time offer at their internship company. However, my company did not have the headcount to make me an offer.  
As my internship was coming to an end and bootcamp graduation date loomed near, I applied to well over 160 jobs over the course of about 2 months. I didn't receive a response from the majority of them (and by majority, I mean VAST majority - my job tracking spreadsheet reflects something like 90% never responded). A lot of things went through my head at this time, some of the main ones being 1) I wish I'd known sooner how hard this would be 2)Oh my god, what if I'd put my life on hold to attend Ada Developers Academy and it all amounts to NOTHING???
When my friend Mary (also in my class, with the same situation) and I finally received job offers, we wanted to share our experiences and what we'd learned with the classes that came after us, so we put together a talk and we've given it to every class that came after us. 

I'd love to adapt this talk to a wider audience and share it with early-career and aspiring devs.","I know that the talk time cap is 15 minutes and that my outline is pretty long. If accepted I am aware that I really need to make it more concise to ensure it fits in the time window. I'd also like to ensure that it's relevant to the widest Codeland audience people, so I would consider adding things like what you could do to strengthen your resume if you don't have an internship (i.e joining local tech groups, contributing to open source, side projects).","My company would not be paying for my plane ticket and hotel stay, so I would love for these to be covered as a speaker.

I used a variety of resources to get here, primarily Flatiron School's online course.

One question I get asked often by people trying to decide which bootcamp they should enroll in is which languages/frameworks they should be learning.

I generally answered that by telling them that the specific language/framework shouldn't matter, after all, chances are you will need to learn a whole new stack once you get your first job. What should matter is that the bootcamp/course gives the students the tools they need to learn on their own. In other words, in a good bootcamp, you don't learn a language, you learn how to learn.

Recently I got into this discussion with a friend of mine, and they asked me to clarify what it is that I meant by ""learning to learn""; what are the skills needed to learn how to learn and how can someone new to programming learn those skills?

That started a whole discussion; I had never bothered to quantify what are the actual skills that help developers learn new technologies.

After some back-and-forth, I managed to narrow it down to three skills plus one: learning how to read/understand error messages, learning how to Google things, and learning how to read/understand documentation. From my experience as a developer, I can say that I spend 90% of my workday doing one of those three things (the last skill isn't a skill needed to help you learn things on your own, it's to know when to take a step back and ask for help).

Each of these skills is a talk onto itself, and if I had a 45-60 minute time slot I would have loved to delve into each one in depth, but I do believe I can bring the main point out in a 15-minute talk as well:

1. Reading error messages: that was one of the first lessons I had to learn when learning to code, and, in my opinion, what separates developers from the rest of society. Back in my ""civilian life"" error messages were scary, they were usually opaque, and felt like the computer was screaming at me in a foreign language and blaming me for something which it probably thought was my fault. As developers, we need to realize error messages are our friends; they give us clues and directions where to find the bugs in our code.

2. How to Google things: as a developer, you will spend the majority of the time doing things you don't know by heart. Google (or DuckDuckGo, Bing, etc.) will be your best friend. Learning how to structure your query for best results is an art that comes with experience, but some rules will help you get started (include the language you are using, use well-defined keywords, know which results are more likely to be helpful).

3.  How to read technical documentation: languages/frameworks have many features and functions, and unless you use a certain function on a semi-regular basis, it is unlikely that you will have the syntax memorized. The documentation for most languages is the most comprehensive and concise reference for language features, saving you the trouble of memorizing hundreds of obscure language features. Ruby has about 20 ways to iterate of an array. Someone who has the goal of learning Ruby might think they have to memorize all 20 while someone who has the goal of learning how to learn will only have to remember that they can find all of the ways of iterating over an array in the documentation on Ruby's Enumerable module. The trouble is that the documentation can look intimidating to new coders; the conciseness means that the page can seem like a scary wall of jargon and technical terms, but with practice, you can learn the patterns and learn how to find the information you need. 

And lastly, 4. knowing when to step back and ask for help: none of us ever did it on our own, the ""self-taught developer"" is a myth. Surrounding yourself with a network of fellow learners and mentors, and knowing when/how to leverage it will mean that you don't have to spend days banging your head against the keyboard for a simple typo that a second pair of eyes would have caught (though we've all been there :)","Many people learning to code (or thinking of learning to code) are asking the wrong questions. They want to know which languages/frameworks/technologies they should be learning when the truth is that it doesn't matter as much as they think.

I went to a bootcamp that taught me Rails/React, and then I got a job writing PHP, and another one a half a year later that has me writing Go all day. Does that mean the Ruby/JS skills I learned in bootcamp were a waste because I didn't end up using them? I don't think so. The primary skill I learned in bootcamp was how to learn so that when I joined a PHP team, I was able to be productive in PHP within a week, and when I switched to Go, I was able to pick that up as well.

Switching our focus from thinking we need to learn a specific technology and realizing that we need to learn how to learn technology will make us better students and bring us closer to our coding goals.","In addition to the change in mindset mentioned in the ""Problem"" section, participants will hopefully learn some specific tips/tricks related to the three skills outlined; reading error messages, crafting better Google queries, and reading technical documentation.",Empowered to continue their learning journey knowing the areas they should be focusing on.,"Most of the talk is from conversations I've had with people starting out in their journey.

I think is fundamental because is the kind of testing that beginners, intermmediate and advanced engineers should write, no matter they work as frontend, with frameworks or vanilla or even backend.

After studying art in college, I moved to London to do a Masters in writing, where I‚Äôve now live and worked as a writer and editor for 4 years. Even though I never considered myself a ‚Äòtechie‚Äô person, I‚Äôve always been curious about programming.

For as long as I can remember, I just assumed you had to be ‚Äònaturally good‚Äô at computers to understand coding. Why? Honestly, my image of tech was gradually built in response to what I saw in Irish cinemas and TV (e.g. Napoloen Dynamite‚Äôs brother). It was only after I moved to London, encouraged by a co-worker to go to a coding meetup for people underrepresented in tech, that I discovered that actually, I could be a part of the coding community. Since that first meetup about 8 months ago, I‚Äôve been teaching myself to code and loving it. 

I want to share my story with new developers - especially those who may be just thinking about learning but feeling hesitant - to show them that pop culture stereotypes about ‚Äòtechie people‚Äô don‚Äôt have to dictate their ideas of this industry. You don‚Äôt have to know anything about tech to get started.

This talk will give you the tips and tools you need to help you navigate your fear of tech. 

I will start by outlining how and why I felt disenfranchised by the tech world growing up in Ireland. I will do this by introducing myself, my perceptions of tech as ‚Äògeeky and glamorous‚Äô, how this image was built up over time in response to pop-culture, and how, as a result, I ended up with an ingrained idea of this divide between ‚Äòtechie‚Äô and ‚Äònon-techie‚Äô people.

During the middle of the talk I will then discuss how I came to realise that my views were built on a myth: that ‚Äòtechies‚Äô and ‚Äònon-techies‚Äô weren‚Äôt different as people, it was just a matter of approach. I will outline how I used to approach solving problems by focussing on a single solution over and over again, and how I came to realise that this path was doomed because it was born from frustration, not curiosity. Here is where the talk will get a little technical.

By realising that I needed to shift my approach, I discovered the joy of problem solving through: googling, testing, googling some more, testing some more, watching some youtube tutorials, reading through forums, asking some friends, and testing something out again. I will cite some good resources for beginners such as codebar tutorials, freecodecamp exercises and games like Flexbox Froggy and CSS Diner, while highlighting the importance of developing patience as a core skill. I‚Äôll then transition into the end of the talk by reiterating that these tools can not only be used to help you develop technically, but they can help you shift your problem-solving perspective from frustration, to curiosity. I will emphasise that this mindset is what will sustain you during those days when you feel like you want to give up.

To end this talk I will recap on the perceived inaccessibility of the tech industry, the feelings of intimidation and overwhelm I faced, and how I got over that hump by de-bunking my perception of ‚Äòtechie people‚Äô, shifting my perspective, and practising the art of patience. I will then outline some practical examples of useful resources for tech newbies like me, e.g. codebar meetups, codebar slack channel, freecodecamp exersizes, stack overflow, Ada‚Äôs List, learning games like Flexbox Froggy and CSS Diner, books like Javascript: The Good Parts, inspiring developers like Mandy Michael and Rachel Andrew, conferences for beginners like this one, You Got This, and New Adventures in Web Design. I will end on a high note, encouraging anyone who‚Äôs thinking about learning, who feels like maybe they‚Äôre not smart enough or not ‚Äòtechie‚Äô enough, to take that initial step towards learning to code. I will promise them, they will be surprised.","This talk addresses the all too common feeling of intimidation and overwhelm faced by code newbies all over the world. It is both interesting and valuable to attendees because it will help new and growing developers to feel less scared, and more empowered.","I want my audience not only to feel inspired and empowered to make those first steps towards learning to code, but to go and do it. With a different perspective on tech and learning, I want them to go and watch the tutorials, follow the lessons, attend the meetups and write the code that will kickstart their journeys into tech, and sustain it thereafter.",Inspired and empowered.,"How women were pushed out of programming:
In the 1950s, 30-50% of programmers were women. As this work began to attract higher salaries and a reputation as ‚Äòintellectually strenuous‚Äô, men formed professional organisations aiming to discourage the hiring of women, e.g. running ad campaigns portraying women as gossiping time-wasters: https://timeline.com/women-pioneered-computer-programming-then-men-took-their-industry-over-c2959b822523

Despite the allure of thinking of testing as a natural first step in any development, the reality of changing priorities complicates things, and often our predecessors may have designed testing frameworks that completely neglect the systems we‚Äôve grown to support.

Joining my first startup illustrated to me the inherent conflict between ensuring the reliability of a product while simultaneously iterating over it in an effort to increase the user experience. As engineers, we are all juggling resources to efficiently meet customer and product asks as quickly as possible, and in some cases, we may be responsible for codebases that not only predate our tenure but that predate our current business case.

Over time, the engineers on my team found ourselves struggling with the concept of moving development forward with a system that was complex to fully automate, and a sense that our existing integration and unit tests weren‚Äôt going to cut it if we were ever going to reach a place where deployments were anything other than fear-inducing.

The question remained - how do you patch in coverage and increase reliability while continually developing a codebase and adding on new features? How do you handle complex software flows that depend on previous API calls, making mocking less effective? Can you then confidently test in production(!)? And what does it mean to reprioritize testing in a system after years of neglect? All of these are questions I hope to begin to answer in this talk, as well encourage the audience to consider on their own terms.","The tech debt that startups accrue, the contradictions between concepts of ""good"" testing practices and the reality of testing, how to prioritize testing without access to a dedicated QA team. ","I hope that the audience leaves feeling empowered to build out and advocate for more testing in either personal projects or work spaces, and with the idea that it's never too late to prioritize testing. ","I would like the audience to feel slightly amused by the perils of my story, but also more confident in themselves as coders or potential coders, as I think the concept of ""it's never too late"" can apply to many things. Ideally, they would also get excited about testing! ","In addition to personal stories from myself and my teammates, I will present on documentation for the testing framework we ended up using (https://taverntesting.github.io/), as well as some articles I have found interesting (still a work in progress, and I plan to add more articles as I continue to research):

Having grown up in a space where I was in the majority, and then moving to Portland (the whitest major city), I felt very out of place. I bring an interesting perspective as someone who grew up in a hyper-competitive/perfectionist environment, to a city and an industry that is dominated by certain demographics that don't carry the same emotional weight or self-worth problems I dealt with growing up. I can relate to people entering an industry where they are the minority and how that makes them feel. ",Currently looking for my first full-time developer role,,"In-person bootcamp,""Collection of resources (blog posts, books, tutorials, workshops, etc.)"",Online learning platforms",,Health/Life Sciences,,T20: Where Are All The WoC?,None,,"Beginning: Intro to who I am, where I come from (Hawaii), and where I am now (Portland). Talk about how I not only moved to a new very white industry, I moved to Portland which is claimed to be the whitest city in America. 

Middle: First, I will address the problem that exists. Talk about the struggles of having cultural differences with your coworkers, employers, hiring teams, etc. How communication and interviewing can be hard and discouraging when interviewing as a WoC in tech because the language you were raised using is different than someone from a different cultural background, giving you a disadvantage. I will provide anecdotes from my own experience about not ever being interviewed by a WoC. Passive Aggressive and defensive responses I received when I tried to provide feedback to companies about hiring processes. 

Next, I will talk about how I overcame this sense of being othered. I got on Twitter and FOUND WoC in tech through organizations that support women and enbies. I found role models in the industry and interacted with them. More than likely, they will be willing to help you out. I will give personal anecdotes on things I started to do to engage with the community more (found OSS projects led by women particularly WoC). For me, I prefer to make most of my connections online than in-person, because I don't necessarily feel comfortable at meetups in Portland being the only WoC in the room. Going to women and enby focused conferences like Write, Speak, Code, also expanded my network of amazing WoC. 

End: I will encourage the attendees to not only find a mentor, but to continuously help other WoC. It can be lonely out there in everyone's separate cities, especially if the cities lack diversity. Solidarity is key. Even if you haven't been coding for that long, it is likely that someone has been coding even shorter than you have, and there is a lot you can teach them. Be the mentor you want to have. ","The lack of diversity and inclusion in tech, especially in white cities. This is important for attendees because a lot of Code Newbies are women and PoC who are career changers. They weren't encouraged to pursue engineering when they were going through school, because of societal constraints...or maybe they didn't have the finances to go to college but are able to learn via the internet. This talk is for these underrepresented folks to learn how to better navigate the spaces they find themselves in when entering tech. I wish I had heard a talk like this when I first started out. ","I want them to help others grow in the community! URM need to support other URM so that tech can get more diverse and inclusive. Even if they are knew to coding, they can still help inspire others. Inspiration is what drives this industry, and representation definitely plays a role when being inspired.","I want URM to feel seen and less alone on this journey. I want them to feel a sense of solidarity. Also, so white folks, especially men can see through the eyes of a WoC in tech. It is important to have this awareness. ",I plan to interview WoC who are leading communities and have strong technical backgrounds. I want to hear about their journey as well. I will also look at reporting that companies do on their diversity. ,"I am the right person for this talk, because I went from feeling comfort in being in a room full of people like me, to being the only one. This jarring experience can help me empathize with people who may have gone through the same thing. Being the only minority in a room full of white people can cause a lot of stress, and I want to help people lessen that stress and learn how to stay in this industry that sometimes feels like it is trying to gatekeep.

""Hey Molly-

Jennifer is a brilliant engineer at EvilCorp who had another career before switching to dev work. She has been looking for mentorship from someone along her path but her current city is a small world in software.

I hope you two have a productive chat :)""

Wait, what?! You want me to mentor someone? Now, I have taught a lot of junior devs over the years, but strictly on a professional, here is how you write code, level. I never found myself in a position to give anything besides black and white technical advice. I panicked, and immediately wanted to reply you‚Äôve got the wrong girl! Luckily, I didn‚Äôt. Instead, I did what my mom taught me to do and slept on it.

The next day, I decided the least I could do was try to help so I did. When we first started emailing I could tell she was having confidence issues and that is where I decided to focus. If I could get her confident I knew everything else would fall into place. I suggested a bunch of things she could try to help her gain confidence hoping that at least one would click and work. 
The next month, during our monthly chat she was a different person! Low and behold, she had taken my advice and ran with it. Seeing all the good it did her made me immediately want to share it with the world! Below is the advice I gave. 

Review Senior Devs' PR's
Senior devs make mistakes too! Nothing gives you more confidence than being able to spot a bug or typo in a senior level dev‚Äôs PR. Worst case, you don't find any bugs but you learn something from reading the code. When I was starting out, there was a Sr. dev who knew everything about Enumerable and always wrote the most compact, delightful enumerable code. Every Enumerable trick I know, I learned from reading his PRs.
On the flip side, senior dev's, if a junior finds a bug in your PR, don't brush it off, give them kudos! A simple ""Good find!"" response will probably go a lot further than you think at boosting someone else's confidence.

Teach! Teach! Teach!
A lot of people learn via bootcamps and then land their first dev job and never look back. After you have gained some experience, consider going back to your original bootcamp and seeing if they are looking for tutors or mentors. Participate in local pair programming meetups. Helping someone else learn how to code will help you realize and focus on all that stuff you do know rather than the stuff you don‚Äôt. Usually, you realize you know a lot more than you thought you did!

Find Your Niche and be the champion at it
This could be anything from owning a piece of code to reviewing PRs to monitoring a piece of infrastructure. It doesn‚Äôt matter what your niche is, just that you have one. Find something you can master and be the go to person for it. By doing this, you will make yourself needed. Nothing instills confidence more than the feeling of being needed.

Find Your Person
When you start out at a new company, find your person. Find that person who believes in you more than you believe in you. It doesn‚Äôt need to be a senior dev; it could be a peer. The key is that it needs to be someone that knows you professionally and understands what you do. It works even better if it is someone you work with every day. Those days when you feel like you have messed everything up, that person will be there to remind you that you haven‚Äôt.
Starting at a new company can be intimidating and finding someone can be hard at first. Make sure to attend work events and take time during the day to learn more about your coworkers. Pair code with others to get to know them better. It will take some effort, but the payoff is worth it.

Envision Yourself Succeeding
""You can't outperform your self image"" - Mind Gym: An Athlete's Guide to Inner Excellence
I have read multiple books on sports psychology and one of the universal messages is that if you want to succeed, you need to envision it.","Imposter Syndrome!

That book really drilled home how much of a role confidence plays in our ability to perform which is something I want to stress in the talk. It also stresses that confidence is not just something you can acquire in a day. You have to work at it. You have to train your mind to gain confidence the same way you would train your body. I think often less experienced devs might look at someone who is confident and think they have always been that way, but often that is not the case. You have to work at it.

On my journey I hit all the emotions from elated to lonely, motivated to isolated, and everything in between.

2012 - The Year Of Change
In 2012, two years after graduating college, I was working as an options trader. I had just gotten married and my husband and I had just moved into a beautiful new house with our two adorable dogs. Life was great! But things didn't stay that way for long.

Around March of that year I started to get restless. Work was fine, but it wasn't fulfilling. I started reading about all these tech startups and how they were changing the entire landscape of the internet. THAT sounded exciting to me. Much more exciting than taking bets on which way the market was going to swing on any given day.

In April, my husband got sick. He ended up in the hospital with pneumonia for 3 days. While sitting in the hospital with him, reading Hacker News and reflecting on how short life is(because that is what everyone does in a hospital!), I made the decision to change my career. After I had made the decision personally, I of course had to tell my husband. I was terrified of what he was going to think.

Not only would I be leaving a steady job, but that job was working for my father-in-law's company! I would be turning down working in the family business to go work in a world I hardly knew anything about. Even typing this out now, I'm not sure how I was able to make such a bold move.

Before I could make the leap though, I wanted to have some sort of plan. I started brainstorming ideas for websites I could make. I ended up landing on a website I called WaterCoolerMeetings.com. Go ahead, check it out, it really is something...special üôà. The purpose of it was to connect mentors with mentees. Think LinkedIn, but with human interaction as the number one goal. With idea in hand, I found the Michael Hartl tutorial for building a Twitter app, and like any good novice, built the twitter app to use as a base for my website.

Taking the Leap
Shortly after starting my new website, I gave my 2 week notice at work. The day I did it, I felt physically ill. Not only did I have to give notice to my direct boss, but prior to that, I had to sit down and tell my father-in-law. The enormity of the decision was overwhelming. I was leaving an incredibly stable job(hello! I was working for me father-in-law's company, I mean, the job was ""won't ever be fired"" stable!) to hack on a website and learn Ruby on Rails. Despite the nerves, I ripped the bandaid off!

After quitting, I dove head first into coding. I worked tirelessly for 3 months building WaterCoolerMeetings.com into the best site possible. Nights and weekends, I was consumed with coding all the time. Despite loving what I was doing, it wasn't long before I started to feel isolated. I didn't know anyone else in the industry. I was not on Twitter. There were no supportive groups that I knew of to ask for help. I began longing to be a part of a team and that is what led me to start looking for my first dev job. I wanted something that would allow me to learn from and work with other people while working on WaterCoolerMeetings.com on the side.

My First Dev Job
When I started job hunting, my first resource was the Hacker New's jobs page. I went there and started skimming the postings. Most the jobs at the time were for companies in San Fransisco. Ideally, I wanted something in Chicago, so the first Chicago posting I saw, I jumped on. One small problem though, they wanted a full time web developer and I knew I was far from that. Regardless, I emailed them anyways to see what they thought about taking on a junior. Low and behold, they were open to it! I went and interviewed and got an offer for a paid internship with option to hire after 6 months.

I also applied to another company in San Fransisco. That job was my dream job! However, after flying all the way out there on my own dime for an interview, I was rejected because I was too junior. At the time, I was devastated. But, as my Mom says, ""Everything happens for a reason!"" I ended up taking the job at the Chicago company and boy am I glad I did.

I hustled like crazy for 6 months and it all paid off when I was hired full time after my internship. That company, and the 3 guys I worked with there, laid the foundation that my career has been built on. I could never thank them enough for all they taught me.

Flash Forward 6 Years
Looking back on all of this now, I shake my head and smile at how naive I was about everything. However, that unbridled enthusiasm is what helped get me my first dev job. I had no idea how crazy it was for someone with only 3 months experience to apply for a spot on a 3 person dev team. **Don't let preconceived notions or assumptions ever stop you! Be bold, go after every single lead you can.** Meet all the people you can and embrace every new connection. You never ever know which one might lead to the opportunity of a lifetime.

I can now say, with 100% certainty, that I have no regrets. For the first year or so it was touch and go. It wasn't until after two solid years that I was no longer looking back. If you just took that leap and are terrified that it might turn out badly, HAVE FAITH! If you choose to become a developer because you like a challenge, because you like to build things, because you want a career that gives you the tools to do just about do whatever you want, then you are on the right path! Keep honing those skills, tackling new challenges, and meeting new people and you will find your spot in this incredible technical world!","Making the leap into coding from another career can be scary. Especially when you are leaving a steady job and a steady paycheck for the unknown. I want people to know that they are not alone in this. I have done it and survived. Other's have done it and survived. I also want to encourage those new to the industry not to hold back or limit themselves when it comes to looking for jobs. If you like a company, email them! You never know what they might be able to offer to the right person. ","I want those who have recently just started their coding journey to be confident that they are on the right path. I also want to offer them a couple small pieces of advice as they go job hunting such as going after every lead possible and emailing companies that sound interesting even if they don't have a Jr. position listed. It only takes 1 yes and you never know where that might come from. (my lord, I sound just like my mother, what is happening!)",ü§ó All the warm and fuzzies!

I want to share my burnout story to let others know they are not alone and to shed some light on something many people don't talk about. 

I Can Do it All
I have been working at my company for over 3 years now. When I started, we were a small team of 30 people. Now, we have over 120. Because I have been around so long, I have A LOT of domain knowledge about our entire application. I have personally written a good amount of the application code, so it makes sense that I know all its ins and outs. Up until 6 months ago, anytime someone needed help or an on-call issue arose, I was the go to person. Everyone knew I could solve just about any problem the fastest, so they came to me.

At first, this was exhilarating! Who doesn't want to feel needed all the time?! I embraced my role as the go-to person. When someone needed help, I jumped right in. I never said no. I was the Olivia Pope of Kenna! (Show GIF)

In the early days, this was sustainable because the application and team were relatively small. However, as the team grew and the application expanded, it started to take its toll on me.

Worse thing was, I was not the first to notice. My team lead and those around me noticed it first. They started asking me if I needed help or if I wanted to hand off some of the load. Every time I replied, ""Nah, it's fine, I can handle it."" Eventually, it sucked the life out of me. I became more irritable at work and towards my coworkers. BUT, I kept trying to do it all. I am one of those people that won't let up. I tend to be a people pleaser and I always want to help if I can.

Intervention
Eventually, my incredible coworkers stepped in. One coworker sat me down and laid it out for me using an analogy that was spot on. He said, ""Molly, you are an addict."" I laughed in response, but his face remained deadly serious and he continued. ""Every time you get asked for help, it gives you a high. It is no different than someone who uses drugs. When they take a hit, they immediately feel good in the moment, but it takes a toll on their body. You being ""on-call"" 24/7 is taking a toll on you and it needs to stop.""

Following this talk, I was forcefully kicked out of Slack channels that were used for on-call issues so I couldn't even be tempted to help. A couple people took my next on-call rotations and everyone laid down a rule that unless the site was down, no one was allowed to ask me for help. I was the last line of defense.

In the end, it worked! It wasn't the easiest transition for me. At first, I felt like I was neglecting my job. But after a couple of weeks, it got easier, and soon I was back to my old self. You know what the best part was? Because I let other people solve the problems as they arose, they became more knowledgable about our application. Now, application knowledge is more spread out. The last few big on-call blow ups, I have not even been a part of. It has been incredibly freeing. Over the holidays, I went on vacation, and for the first time, I didn't open my laptop once!!! That used to be unheard of for me.

Burnout Advice
My advice looking back on the whole situation is: **Be aware not only of yourself, but also of those around you.**

You always want to be aware of your own habits and moods, but also keep tabs on your coworkers. Check in with them if they seem ""off"" to you. **Some people might need you to step in and give them permission to take a break.**

**On the flip side, if you need help dealing with burnout, ASK!** Those around you have likely gone through what you are going through and would be happy to help in any way they can. If there is no one you trust to go to, try a coworker or even an online community like #CodeNewbie.  Even just writing out what you are going through can be extremely helpful. Whatever you do, DONT deal with it alone.","Handling burnout which is not often talked about in our industry. I had a tough time dealing with it and after I had gone through it I didn't really think much of it. Then I was inspired by a blog post to share my own story via my blog. I figured it would be good to reflect on it so I wouldn't make the same mistake twice. I never thought it would be that popular of a topic but, in the end, the story hit home for A LOT of people. Here is the blog post https://dev.to/molly_struve/i-cant-do-it-all-my-burnout-story-1e54

Being a seasoned mentor for Google Code-In, Google summer of code and a GitHub Campus Expert at his university, Pranav has a deep understanding of how to help new developers through Open Source. He is also passionate about helping online communities be more aware of diversity and inclusion.
Soon to be joining Microsoft, Pranav hopes to share his learnings on how contributing to Open Source can help developers learn invaluable skills at any stage of their career.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/prnvdixit/,https://twitter.com/prnvdixit,Male,Asian / Pacific Islander,,India,"From someone who had no idea about CS domain itself on entering university to reaching a decent level of expertise as a developer, the journey has been nothing short of a roller-coaster ride.

Looking back, I believe that getting introduced to Open Source technologies at the right time has a lot to do with where I am today.  From learning the intricacies of python by reading other people's code on GitHub to 'finding' how to ask questions and why the quality of code is as important as its performance in real life, most of what I learned in my small journey is from this vast world of Open Source.

Still, it was only after my manager's 1:1 review at the end of my internship at Microsoft, that I felt the need to share these learnings with everyone.

- Enhancing your technical skill-set
- Understanding and developing core skills
- How to build inclusive spaces
- And the personal benefits you can gain from contributing to Open Source.


Section One: ""Becoming better at Tech""
 
Learning something new whether a programming language or a new framework is a daunting task. It's never an overnight accomplishment, where the next day you are suddenly well versed. We will see how contributing to Open Source can help you with that.  
    - Learning some new language/technology  
    - Writing structured, tested, quality code  
    - Using resources/docs in a better way  
      
      

Section Two: ""Core skills"" 

""Why do I need to hone my speaking skills when my code can do all the talking""  

We will also be discussing one of the most neglected parts of the Computer Science domain.  
    - Interpersonal skills/Building your network  
    - Public speaking and the dreaded impostor syndrome  
    
    

Section Three: ""Diverse and Inclusive workspaces""  

It's no secret that fundamental biases at workplaces are commonly a result of ignoring the struggles someone else faced to reach to that point. We will discuss how being a part of GitHub campus expert program allowed me to get the first-hand experience in this. We will also cover what else might be required apart from creating more opportunities when it comes to ensuring fair representation in tech space.  
 
 

Section Four: ""Personal benefits"" 

Quite often, the biggest motivation for the majority of the students and new developers to participate in Open Source programs and projects are the perks associated with it. We would be taking a look at some of them as well.  
        - Participation in Open source programs - As a tech experience (resume booster), Stipend
        - Attending conferences, visiting locations for (almost!) free  ","Our value as a developer is not just about being good at implementing complex logic; how we approach these problems and how we work with others matters too. For some developers working in a collaborative environment, this comes naturally; but for others, especially for newcomers to this tech industry, it can take a bit of patience and practice.

In this talk we will follow my journey from a civil engineering student to a full-time developer; and how my involvement in Open Source and the GitHub Campus Experts program helped me get here.","The key takeaways of this talk for:-
  - Students: What you can gain from starting contributing to Open Source in terms of both - personal benefits as well as technical knowledge.
  - Newcomer developers: Ways to refine your development workflow overcoming your own vulnerabilities and insecurities, including poor coding methodologies or just fear of public speaking.
  - Tech leads/Engineering managers:  What can be done to make tech space more welcoming to people from underrepresented groups as well as to newcomers.","This talk is right at the 'least technical' end of the conference talk spectrum but probably the most important. Hence; no brainstorming, nothing too techy, no code syntax, no prerequisites, just a fair share of learnings from my small yet exciting journey. I expect everyone to leave with an understanding and a mutual sense of Open Source in general.","I'm well aware that whatever I have experienced about Open Source is just a small drop in the ocean of what is out there. So, I plan to go through anecdotes, blogs (personal/medium), talks of people who've been in this boat before me.","I have been a two-time mentor in Google Code-In and Google Summer of Code. My involvement with these programs helped me get a better understanding of the problems that newcomers face during their onboarding phases.

Also as a GitHub campus expert, I've been involved with building a developer community ground-up at my university. This role enabled me to get a deeper understanding of what needs to be done when the focus of members of the community is more inclined towards how development can help anyone in getting a job.

I chose this major because I had worked in retail and didn't have any other clue what I wanted to do. I had a few marketing-related jobs after college but always felt like I didn't have it in me to be ""good"" at that field. I even got an MBA to try to move myself forward but I still felt stuck. I was confused because I knew I was a smart person - why was I faltering professionally? Fast forward to 2016. I was pregnant, between jobs due to my husband's job relocation and at a bit of a crossroads. I had worked at an ad agency for 6 years before the move, but didn't necessarily want to keep doing that. I had been surrounded by all these people creating amazing stuff. I was managing clients and projects, but I wanted to be one of the people MAKING stuff. I had a client whose website was managed by a freelancer who was impossible to reach, so I had this thought that I could learn to code and take it over.  I started doing a few tutorials, but my regular duties prevailed. So when this move happened, it seemed like a great opportunity to finally really dig in to coding.

- I'd start with a quick overview of my background and how I came to discover my passion for coding.
---I would highlight the fact that I basically felt lost, professionally and really struggled with my self-perceived inadequacies. I'd picked a career path (marketing) that I had no passion for but that I thought would be easy because it was easy in school. I wish I'd had the awareness and foresight to challenge myself then with coding or something else STEM-related. I just had literally no concept that those avenues were open to me. 
---I've been freelancing while coding (https://sassafrasbiz.com) and could share some sites I have done for clients. 

- Next I'd cover my personal learning journey, including the online tutorials/resources I used, classes I took, groups I joined, etc.
---I'd like to highlight that I took a continuing ed class at NYU, billed as an intermediate Frontend Development course. It ended up being a MEAN-stack class, which I thought was great. At the beginning, it was about 50/50 women/men. After the first week, I was one of I think 3 women left in a class of 12 or so people. I was pregnant during the class and for my final project I created a baby gear registry page. (it's not live, but you can see it in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9gH8PgYW00)
---My new motto is, if it looks interesting, click the link and APPLY FOR IT! That's how I ended up being accepted to complete a Udacity Front-End Nanodegree on a Grow with Google scholarship, and also how I came to be a part of MotherCoders (mothercoders.org) in their first NYC cohort. And, it's why I'm filling out this application right now ;-).  
---The Nanodegree was a very comprehensive course that involved lessons and about 7 projects over an 8 month timeframe. It was through this program that I learned about React, which I really love. 
---MotherCoders is an awesome group, founded by Tina Lee, who saw a need to find a way to tap into the tremendous potential of mothers who might otherwise be left out of the tech workforce. I have a little more coding experience than some of the other women in the group, so I'm actually able to help them learn as we go along. I didn't realize how much I'd enjoy that aspect of it. I'd like to highlight that as a way to emphasize how much more can be accomplished by collaborating rather than competing, especially among women, because after all, today is International Women's Day!
---Finally, I'd share the project that I'll be sharing at MotherCoders Demo Day in April - a website that is a marketplace for mothers who are business owners to patronize each other's services and create a mutually rising tide of success!","I think a lack of awareness of opportunities or learning paths has been a big barrier to entry for girls when it comes to tech. I know that there are tons of awesome organizations doing great things with school-age kids, so that's starting to change, but girls still tend to drop-off of the tech trajectory around middle school. I want to use my personal ""what-if's"" and ""why didn't I...'s"" to encourage everyone to go out and be a part of changing that scenario, whether that's by mentoring or encouraging a young girl, or by taking the time to sit down with a peer who is interested in coding but doesn't know how to start learning.

I would love to be able to share that, and I think by getting attendees to really think about what coding has done for them, even if they are early in their journey, they will leave feeling empowered to help others kick off or progress along their own journeys.

I have done coding since I was in 8th grade (I'm 32 now), but never at a computer science level. I only know basic algorithms and I know data structures decently well, but I have a lot to learn on the coding front. You could say I'm a generalist although I want to become a better developer.

Additionally, I have a strong interesting in developing leadership skills and have been pretty active in Toastmasters which focuses on developing leaders and public speaking skills.

I am an introvert, but I love working with people. I struggled a lot trying to find my first jobs and figuring out how to stand out in interviews. I spent a lot of time and energy on figuring out how to clean up my resume, leave a good impression with interviewers, and progressing in my career.

I've also experienced some serious burnout and can talk a great deal about that and understand what eager learners may run into if they don't manage themselves well.

I'm still learning to be a good developer, but I think I have some unique perspectives on developing a career for folks that are just getting started as developers.",Other,"I've never been a full-time developer, but I have 5 years FT experience and 6 years PT experience in more operational roles.

Here are my tips for getting a job in tech.

1. Work on some projects on your own. They can be open source, demo projects (think web calculator), something running in the cloud, anything! When a recruiter asks for 1-2 years of experience and you have none, your personal projects are gold. Bonus points if your projects are something you are interested in (Machine learning, Gaming, Web Dev, etc).

2. Your resume is important, but remember the role of the resume is to get you an interview. Often in entry or junior level positions, recruiters will get a lot of candidates. Multiply that by all the roles that they have to fill and they get good at spotting a good potential candidate. They often end up looking at your resume for only a matter of seconds before moving on to the next resume. The trick is to design your resume in such a way that they see the important information first. If you have no experience, your personal projects should come before your work experience because it's more important that you built a simple calculator app than that time you sold tickets at a movie theater. Review the job description. Use the requirements to help tailor your resume to the job. If they ask for Google Cloud experience, learn how to deploy a simple app on Google Cloud and then you can say in your projects that you have an app running on Google Cloud! Verbiage is also important if you do have some work experience because they want to see results you delivered in your past job, not necessarily what your job role was.

3. Leaving a good impression is really important when interviewing. Sometimes they give you the name of your interviewer. You can often look them up on LinkedIn and get a feel for who you're talking to which will help you ask meaningful questions at the end of the interview. Practice interviewing and answering confidently. Good posture, eye contact, and sometimes dress can help leave an impression that you are the self-starter you claim to be. Make sure you know your resume backwards and forwards and that you can talk about points in the job description. Make sure you can talk about your projects in technical detail - do some research on the tech you used if needed. When asked about projects or work experience, using story form is often helpful - describe the situation, the problem, and your part in building a solution. For coding practice, hackerrank or leetcode are great resources for programming challenges. Additionally, if you can afford it, the book ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" will be invaluable for years to come.",Job searches. It's interesting to the attendees because many of them are probably new to the coding discipline or are only getting started. The tips in my talk could be very beneficial to them.,I want them to have a list of things they can do to prepare for their next job search. They should be able to walk away knowing more about how to prepare their resume and prepare for interviews.,Confident! Impostor syndrome plagues our industry for a lot of reasons - especially for new coders. I hope to enable them to get past that and get that next job!,"Reports, studies, articles from industry experts (LInkedIn + Glassdoor)","I am not the best coder, but I love helping people. I often find myself surrounded by intelligent people who have helped me in my career.

With the help of FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, and personal projects I was able to land an internship that later turned into a full-time job as a UI developer.

I Was Already Doing UX?,Other,"illustrations , diagrams, and gifs","I. First Encounters with UX
		* User Experience (UX) is about the experience a product or service creates for the people who use it. But Before Revconf 2018 I had no Idea what it was. I will talk about three quotes from three talks from that conf that encourage me to learn about UX
	A. Quote 1. ‚Äú20% of people have a disability, so accessibility is a MUST even for internal apps.‚Äù - Chris Demars @saltnburnem from Focusing On Focus
		1. Helped me to realize that even though I work Internal applications, I need to focus on accessibility too! 
	B.  Sidenote: Talk about Beyonce.com accessibility debacle and spill some tea and read an expert of the lawsuit.
	C. Quote 2. ‚ÄúUX debt is technical debt / UX is EVERYONE‚ÄôS problem‚Äù - John Athayde @boboroshi from UX for Developers 
		2. Helped me to appreciate that User Experience should be seen as a Priority and That everyone on the team has a responsibility to think about it. 
	D. ‚ÄúAccessibility makes life better for EVERYONE‚Äù
 - Aisha Blake @AishaBlake from Web Accessibility: How to Be an A11y
		1. I agree with this statement and I illustrate this by talking about the blue/black or white/gold dress that looks different to different people. Adding not only helps people who use screen readers but clarifies the author's intent for everyone.

II. Wait!!! I Was Already Doing UX?
		*  Talk to Manager about what I learned conference and the need to make UX a priority in our team and project.
		* She agrees and then points out that I already was practicing UX when my teammate and I made the application responsive. I'm mindblown!!!



III. Responsive Design
	*  another front-end developer and I took the initiative and convinced the project owners to allow us time to refactor the UI into components and update the styles to allow for responsive design.
	*By allowing users to be able to use the application on any sized screen, we were improving the user experience. We were doing UX! Without realizing it!


IV. You are doing UX design!!
	* [MAIN POINT] So anytime you have ever made decisions and improvements based on the needs and feedback of the users, you were doing UX!
	* [MAIN POINT] Also Everyone, Yes Everyone has responsibility the shape the experience your product creates for its users. You don‚Äôt need UX or designer in your job title. Regardless of Role or job title, if you are making decisions based on the users, you are doing UX. 


V. G.O.A.T UX Resources!
	* Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability by Steve Krug
	* Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) web Docs
	* Non-Designers Design Book by Robin William",UX is a vast field and understanding what it is and why it's important can be very daunting. Learning about UX will help the products we develop to succeed. ,I want them to see UX and accessibility as something that is approachable and look for ways to improve the user experience of their applications.,Thinking about thier users is an essential part of development. ,"-one of the quotes in my talk uses a statistic. I plan on doing some more research number of folks who have disabilities. 
- I talk about the Beyonce.com accessibility lawsuit. I use a news source for that. ","Most of my past experiences are in the scientific research sector. I do some design and research as a developer, but a lot it is just hacking and debugging JS and CSS. 

What draws me to UX is that design thinking is very similar to scientific thinking. In design, they follow a process that is very similar to the scientific method.

Also, I feel like having this user-centered/ design mindset has really made me a better and happier developer. I went from trying to crank out a lot of features to trying to have the most positive impact on the users. If you ask me, the latter is a better success metric üòÄ.","This talk is based on a blog post I wrote entitled, ""You're Doing UX Unconsciously üò¥, Now Let's Make It Conscious ‚è∞ and Intentional üí™ !"".  https://dev.to/mauricehayward/youre-doing-ux-unconsciously--now-lets-make-it-conscious--and-intentional--3c85 

This blog post is more about thinking about UX in a team setting. I go more in-depth¬†on how we specifically improve the user experience of our project.

I did go to a university for graphic and web design, which has helped with my creative background, but soon after moved into coding and development. I wouldn‚Äôt say my switch to tech was huge but my learning didn‚Äôt fully get started till I moved from Seattle to Portland, where I only knew one person and knew the tech scene was growing. I was much more introverted at the time and began to go to regularly attend meetups, mostly Women Who Code, where I began recognizing similar attendees and be able to strike up a conversation. 

After a few events, I was asked to volunteer with the Women Who Code chapter, and further on, grow into the leadership team as a study night lead! This was a dramatic shift to the quiet office job life I had in Seattle and now am able to grow within a supportive community, learn from others experiences and share my knowledge.",Currently focused on developing my coding skills,,"""Collection of resources (blog posts, books, tutorials, workshops, etc.)"",Online learning platforms",,Art/Creative Coding,,T35: Why So Serious? Side Projects Don‚Äôt Have to Be,Demo of working code,,"My talk will explore where you can gather alternative side project ideas and how you can create a memorable story with a personal twist, leverage alternative ideas to begin a new project, and explore new technology or continue your own self learning. 

Some programmers like to create a base project for new technology, such as a ‚Äòto do‚Äô app when learning a new language or framework to test against what you already know. How many times are you wanting to create this same to do app? Why not look at your daily life and see if there is a problem, no matter how small, you face or your hobbies to brainstorm new and fresh ideas to build a project around? Given the expectation of a project has to be useful from the get go can inhibit stress to even get started building and procrastinate till the next idea comes along.

An example of fixing a small problem in your daily life can come from making an action more efficient. Such as, at my current work place, I was noticed the time and amount of clicks it would take to verify customer‚Äôs domain settings for their account was longer then I thought it should be. Most of my experience is with JavaScript, where I have made a small Chrome extension in the past for personal use, I decided a small extension in the browser could more efficiently verify records for me then repetitively viewing a webpage, finding the example, checking against MX Toolbox and letting the customer know. Instead, you would put the domain in the extension field, click a button to open MX Toolbox for you in a new tab and check the record from there to verify. Even if I just built it for me, I solved a small problem I face nearly every day to ease the verification process and productivity. 

Another example using hobbies for ideas, during the winter, I spend some of my free time binging TV shows and knitting projects. One of the ways to incorporate one or both of these into one is to leverage their respective API, or a sketch redesign of their websites for practice if you are unsure how to use and create with APIs; maybe that will be your starting point! I have not personally worked with either but know IMDB (Internet Movie Database) and Ravelry.com (a social platform for knitters) both have API documentation. 

Once finishing these types of projects, they usually spark up an interesting conversation either with peers or an interviewer, if with the interviewer, that can create a memorable edge in the hiring process and show your passion for other things as well. ","This talk can show newer developers, they don‚Äôt have to have a 100% perfect topic, idea, or project to practice and have fun learning. If you‚Äôre only working on totally flushed out topics and has to be perfect at every step, there‚Äôs a lot of stress that can bar someone from wanting to work on said project consistently and continue to grow.",Push the audience to work on the side projects they may be ruminating on if they have issues with generating ideas what to build as well as help brainstorm for future projects they may want to build. I agree that creating small side projects are better for cementing programming concepts where you can refer back to them. ,"I‚Äôd like the audience to have a new positive push to go work on those projects they may be waiting or forgotten in the past and either rework the old or recreate for the new. Building, sharing, and documenting can help your journey through tech and possibly even others",None at the moment,"I apply this talk to my own side projects and ideas and want to share with others that they too can accomplish side projects to be successful without being too serious.
