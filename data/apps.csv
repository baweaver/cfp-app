I'm a native of Miami, FL who just relocated to Atlanta, GA last year. Sure, Miami's trademarks seem to be glitz, luxury and glamour but that is only restricted to certain areas. The economy is pretty rough and the cost of living is expensive. I've alway pushed for everyone around me to do what they desire, while providing support, albeit monetary or verbal. I also commit to walking and volunteering for organizations that I support - Susan G. Komen Miami Chapter, Walk for Wishes (Make-a Wish foundation), and a few others. ","Yes, with the twitter community for sure. By using the hashtag, I INSTANTLY received multiple direct messages from other enthusiasts that are also interested in Cyber/Info Security. They asked about materials, bootcamps, how to‚Äôs, etc. Im not an expert nor am I at an intermediate level, but I'm a pro at helping in whatever way possible. Honestly that was a breakthrough for me because I was hesitant about starting a twitter account geared towards tech/coding. Interactions like those really solidify my purpose; to help, and contribute just as much as I succeed. I want everyone to win, especially the disenfranchised!","I want to attain certifications geared towards Cyber Security and succeed in the field. I want to immerse myself in the culture of technology to continue learning and helping others as much as I can. I want to pay it forward in a big way, just as others have extended helping hands to me. To be honest, I am still in the process of being exposed to the tech community and all that it has to offer. I saw Codeland's conference advertisement on my timeline (twitter), and thought ""Wow, that seems like a great experience be apart of"". Sounds cliche but I've never been to a conference before, especially one that is an exact reflection of me- a Coding Newbie.

","I left my career in the insurance industry last year to pursue a career in Cyber Security. I am paying out of pocket for my educational expenses while still trying to maintain a sense of balance with my new life in Atlanta.

Outside of the meaningful and impactful projects I‚Äôd like to create for free support resources, my tech goals right now are to be able to support myself and my kids as a freelance developer in the long term, and have the chance to spend my time what I love doing so much - coding - while having the freedom to attend to my families needs by setting my own schedule.","I‚Äôm a single mom and I‚Äôm in the process of applying for student aid to leave my job to attend university.

The buid so far has been 90% following tutorial, and 10% reading the docs and figuring out what I want to apply.",I work full time as an arts adminstrator and professional singer/actor/musician for a non-profit theater company. I've been at my current position for 18 years.,I am an African-American woman,"Tech related, I was selected to be a moderator on Treehouse's Community from answering questions when I was frustrated with my own learning. I found that helping others with topics I had a better grip on was a ton of fun! It helped solidify the info in my mind and gave me a feeling of connection with the people needing help. After that, I joined the Pythonista Cafe, where I'm in a little over my head with the topics, but I'm making connections with other learners in my local area. With my schedule (I generally work 60 - 75 hours a week), it's difficult to make it out to any local meetups. Finding those connections online is extremely important. 
Un-tech related, I also work as vocal teacher and part of my duties include running a summer arts intensive two week workshop, catering to young adults 15 - 21. Students come in and have to work on 4 disciplines (rock singing, dance, sketch comedy, musicianship) no matter their strongest area and learn what it's like to be a professional rock performer.

Being at a conference surrounded by people in the same boat, listening to someone talk in person about things I've just been reading about, and maybe making just one lasting connection would be worth it.

6 months immersion in learning software through bootcamp-like college (Makeschool.com) for the fall of 2018

Currently working as a software developer apprentice as of March 2019.

I've shipped simple games to the App Store, clones of Reddit and Rotten Tomatoes, and a Tweet generator. I've also worked on production level applications such as a Ruby on Rails API and a Gatsby website. I would say I have an average amount of programming experience for my age.","Employed as a software developer apprentice at Raise.dev, a company focused on leveling up new software developers through contracting work.","Member of LGBTQ community, Member of community of developers with disabilities","Before my current job, I worked at a nonprofit STEM Children's museum. I was involved many events we would throw outside of working hours as a volunteer. One of these was our own Mini Maker Faire with ~2000 attendees. I step up each year (including this year in June) to ensure everyone at the event has high speed internet as well as a smooth experience in ticketing.

Back in High School, I was the president of our chapter of the National Honor Society. As president, I worked to secure events for our members to support through volunteering and led volunteering efforts at said events.

More tech related, I regularly attend what events I can. I'm a frequent flyer at SLUG (Swift Language User Group) in NYC.",I have not - I only heard about CodeNewbie recently.,"I'm looking to grow as a developer and discover my ""place"" in tech. I have struggled in a way to find where I fit into the developer community. I'm very happy in my current job as a developer apprentice where the focus is on learning, but I wonder how different my experience will be when I move on to my first ""real"" developer job. 

Attending Codeland fits into this goal by exposing me to fellow new developers, technologies unbeknownst to me, and opportunities for junior developers. It's hard to determine what you want to work in as a programmer without knowing about it in the first place, so exposure is key.","I need the scholarship because although I am employed as a developer apprentice, the pay is more of a living stipend. It leaves little room for expenses outside of commuting to work (which is expensive thanks to the LIRR), paying rent, eating, and so forth.

I'm also a code mentor at a B-Corp near me that trains software developers, and a volunteer admin for a group called CodeBuddies where I also help field questions from new developers often. I'm new myself, but having done this for a couple years it is really nice to be able to give at least guidance on some subjects. ","Yep! I mentioned this in the previous answer. I am a part of the CodeNewbie slack and definitely help people on there, and I do the twitter chats on occasion as well. I also am constantly recommending the group to people in a lot of the Women In Technology groups I'm part of on Facebook - people are studying all over the world and I recommend groups like this where they can get async help on things they are stuck on. For beginners, I also find that slack is so much more user friendly than Stack Overflow. People feel intimidated and harried by using SO and I've avoided it whenever possible since becoming a developer. I love that the CodeNewbie community is so different. ","I'm really trying to finish my degree, and I also do a lot of coding and participating in communities like CodeNewbies, because I want to be a well rounded developer that is a good representation of someone being good at their craft, but also a nice, welcoming, and supportive person. The face of tech is changing, and I want to be part of that. Technology is more present than ever in our lives, and I think that means technology and technologists need to become more kind and more human. 

For me right now, that means working on learning progressive web apps, which I think will give users a lot of choice, and free people from interactions with a dogmatic android vs ios app store experience, and also potentially help people with overcoming weak/poor connectivity to experience applications through the use of service workers. ","As I mentioned previously, I am a full time junior employee and half time student. I currently also dogsit on Rover to pay for my classes so that I don't have to take out student loans.

I also heavily work towards improving web usability, search and navigation, and the overall user experience. Aside from this, I'm a self-paced Online Software Engineering student at Flatiron School working towards a career transition from eCommerce to a developer.",I'm a woman in the LGBTQ community. ,"I have been a supportive community member within my school community since starting in November 2018. I've connected with other students who have reached out to me via Instagram and Twitter, and have connected with them on our school Slack channel, building a small community of 'accountability partners' where we message in our group chat every day with our goals, wins, and struggles and help each other in any way possible. I also participate in #100DaysofCode, and have built my own support system through Twitter since starting school. It amazes me how much seasoned developers are willing to help others who are new to learning. I see every instance of help handed to me as an opportunity to pass it on to someone else and return the favour. Continuing the cycle of help, and support.","I guess this answer goes hand in hand with my response above. Alongside, the #100DaysofCode challenge, I often am tagging #CodeNewbie as well. Which is how I've met a lot of other developers and 'code newbies' who share the same journey as mine. I've connected with quite a few developers, and participate in any conversations I can contribute to, always offering help and feedback where I can. It really amazes me, how easy it is to find and offer support on these social networks.","My code-related goals are to transition my career from eCommerce to tech as a developer. I believe attending Codeland would really help me secure my dreams and build my path. The growth I've made through connecting with students / senior developers / self taught developers etc. online is incredible and has impacted my life and journey immensely. I am so grateful, and I don't believe I would feel as confident in my abilities and my decision to take this leap from my job, to my passion without that support. Taking that to the next level would be to meet these people, and more in person. To hear stories, build my community, learn and of course support others going through the same journey I am, is for sure another step that will take me closer towards making my goals my reality.","I need this scholarship because I cannot afford to attend without it. I work full-time while living with my parents and nephew, and schooling before work, after work, and weekends trying to make my dreams of working in tech come true. My parents are retired, and my nephew is 9, so the main source of income within the house is from me. My monthly tuition for school, after the USD to CAD conversion is about $1050. So with that, and supporting my family there's no way I could afford to travel to NYC for Codeland, let alone afford a hotel while there. Taking this leap into tech is where my heart has been for a long time. It's my passion, I am completely in it. I am a queer woman of colour, pushing through the barriers trying to make a difference and pave a path for those like me living the same struggle. This scholarship would provide me the opportunity to meet more people like me, going through their coding journeys, supporting each other, teaching each other and really helping me transform into the developer I aim to be.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahpaz/,https://twitter.com/sarahjpaz,"Being able to attend Codeland would be such an incredible experience and growth opportunity for me as I continue to learn and build my path in tech.

I get a lot of people that say they've made the wrong choice or that they feel they don't fit in and I make it a personal mission to go out of my way to help such people feel at home and welcome.","No, not yet. But I will surely check it out!","I am interested in attending Codeland because the curriculum of my college is very outdated (we had to give our external practicals in Turbo C++) and I want to learn about the industry standard practices and methods before I graduate so I don't have trouble settling when (or if, because jobs are hard to come by) I get a job. I love meeting new people and forming connections, so I feel networking at Codeland will be a great experience for me. Also, people have this view of India as only a place for outsourcing call centers but there is so much more to this country. I want to bring forward a different aspect of my country, I want to show them there's people like me who want to learn; learn more than whats in our syllabus booklets and the only way for such people to quench their thirst for knowledge is going to be through attending conferences like these. There's a few good conferences in India but the fee for attending such conferences is too high for a college student like me to afford, and there's no provisions for subsidized tickets here.

I have been a victim of this gender bias since I was a child and me choosing to pursue engineering out of my own free will was seen as disrespectful and rebellious by society because computer science is still seen as a ""man's field"" here. I intend on changing this mindset because me being female does not hinder my capability to understand code or design algorithms. There is still a subconscious bias in most older people's minds here which is evident when you present to them a man and a woman with the same technical and academic qualifications; they will almost always select the man. The only times a woman is selected is when there is a quota of women to be chosen and they need to find x women to fill their quota. I want people to see me for my achievements and not because I am doing something as a woman. Tech is still very foreign to most women here and it breaks my heart whenever I hear about cases where a woman is forced into marriage and has to give up studying or when she has to drop out of school because her parents decided it would make her undesirable in the future.

I got to teach the class a little bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub! I mostly know basic front-end technologies and have interests in web accessibility and design systems.","My contract with MotherCoders ended in April and the possibility of continuing with MotherCoders is still up in the end. I am currently between jobs, searching for what possibly could be my first technical role!",I am a Filipina American woman,"Community building is very important to me. Becoming active in the tech community (actually starting off with CodeNewbie!) was one of the reasons I became so motivated in continuing with tech. The support from CodeNewbie and also from the first meetup I ever attended inspired me so much that even though I had no idea what I wanted to pursue career-wise, I knew I wanted to give back. So even though I didn't meet all requirements, I still applied for MotherCoders. Creating community was such an important aspect of the program, and seeing these women thrive, learn unapologetically, and connect with one another was such true joy. I still connect with my now-graduates and am even joining them for an alumni meetup (I'm so proud they are continuing their studies!).

Outside of tech and in my previous life, I had been big on connecting with people. I was always on the outskirts of the communities I was in- bridging the gaps between my interests. I brought sacred dance to my artists and religious communities alike. One of my proudest achievements was bringing several dance groups together to form the Archdiocesan Dance Troupe. Youth groups that otherwise would not have interacted came together for one mission - to dance for something bigger than themselves.

Another recent event was creating an opportunity for young Filipino American Catholics on Long Island to connect with one another but also to their heritage. My family initiated a traditional procession called Flores de Mayo and Santacruzan and I took on the reigns of organizing the day of tasks. It was great to see the Church filled and to see all the young people walk in their traditional Filipino gowns and barong Tagalog. It was quite a sight to see especially with their flower arches! It was reminiscent of my time as a young girl, attending different Filipino American religious events.

Even in college, I was big on bridging the gaps between different people. I was President of FLOW, our Poetry and Spoken Word Club. We held the biggest event on campus- Open Mic, where people across different groups and cliques got together for one night to express themselves and even to surprise others! One event in particular that really brought the campus together was the Outdoor Open Mic, which was an all-afternoon affair that attracted residents and commuters to the Quad, a space that had yet to be utilized. Our adviser said it was the first event that felt like a ""real college event."" We were awarded Student Organization of the Year for the second year in a row that year.","I love CodeNewbie! I try to make the Twitter chats every week! They were one of the first things I did when I joined Twitter months ago. I made a lot of new Twitter friends and honestly, I credit CodeNewbie for giving me the push, motivation, courage, and validation to take the plunge and apply for my first job in tech!","I can't think of a more perfect first conference to attend than Codeland! I want to continue being connected to the tech community- networking, learning from others, and just enjoying the atmosphere of a conference. I want to continue learning more front-end technologies and further expanding my knowledge in web accessibility and work with design systems. I would love to land my first full-time technical role this year!

I am especially interested in attending Codeland because of their CFP mentioning performances! As a dancer, this excites me and cannot see what is in store at this year's conference!","Currently, I am in-between jobs.

In my reporting work, I am to highlight under-served communities; for example, as a tech reporter I endeavour to include sources who are often left out of tech coverage and are under-represented in the field.

S102: Isatou Jobarteh,Isatou Jobarteh,isatouj13@gmail.com,C,"I studied computer Science at the university of The Gambia for 4 years and used java programming language for most of my senior projects. I also did web programming. I am also familiar with Ruby and laravel programming. I am a product Engineer in a software developing company for over 3 years, the company uses ruby on rails to build could service solutions and laravel to build to build websites.","I am an Product Engineer currently working at InSIST Global and a Community Service Volunteer. My current work entails performing regression tests on company software before production and deployment, working directly with eleven schools in creating an E-learning platform through a School Management System and an online learning Application. The system enables over thousand parents to have direct access to their children's academic record, thus empowering the parents in the children's learning process. This is the first time in the history of The Gambia for a platform of such nature to be available to the parents. I am also responsible for maintaining and building websites for our schools",Young women in tech in developing countries,"My quest to make a difference as a woman motivated me to do extracurricular activities at The University of The Gambia. My portfolio as the secretary general of The University of The Gambia IT Association gave me the opportunity to make a difference especially through initiatives that increase the number of girls applying for a bachelors degree in Computer Science or Information Systems. One of the initiatives was organizing a summer camp for girls in high school to introduce them to basic programming as well as careers they can have with a bachelors in Computer Science or information Systems. The following year I became the first female Vice President of the Association. For the first time that year the association conducted a one week countrywide teacher training for 20 schools in the rural Gambia; on basic computer repair skills, programming which i was the instructor on internet safety. This project was predicated based on an empirical need assessment i conducted with my team across the country. At the end of the training all the teachers were equipped with the right skill set to teach high school students at least the basics of computing and how to maintenance some of their lab computers with minor issues.


To further shift the cultural stigma around the education of young girls and the involvement of women in the technology field in my society, i joined a group of 4 girls and together we started with a small space to self train in improving our skills in computer programing especially in object oriented programming using java, online security and privacy and research and networking. We later founded HackathonGirls Banjul which is a club for girls between ages of 8 to 18 in the Gambia, in coordination with the Mozilla Foundation. i am a founding executive and instructor of the club. On a weekly basis we bring together about 50 girls to have a hands on practical on the basics of computing, internet safety, web literacy and create career awareness in the science and technology field. This club has helped the girls get better grades at school especially in their ICT classes and this evident change will help in increasing the number of girls in the science and technology field. The club has expanded over the year and we have three schools in The Gambia that have Mozilla Club of HackathonGirls in their schools and the focus is on girls and improving their IT and web literacy skills.

I was an organizer of the first DjangoGirls programming workshop In The Gambia. The Django girls project was a one day programming workshop that introduced 30 girls to Python Programming followed by weekly meet ups with coaches, as a result 11 of the girls have successfully built websites after the training.

I was also an organizer and couch for a one month intensive training and mentoring program for young girls in designing or developing IT solutions to solve issues in the Education sector. Based on our past experience working with young girls HackathonGirls realized that 70% of young girls already in the IT sector do not have sufficient skills to independently design or develop IT solutions while others find it hard to discover their potentials in other aspects of IT. This has being a prominent issue is significantly affecting the number of girls qualified or confident enough to either further their studies or apply for technical jobs in the IT industry.",No,"My code related goals include, being one of the best product engineers in my country and to archive this, not only do i need to improve my understanding of programming but i need to understand new technologies and how to continue working hard especially in a male dominated filed.

S109: Ariel Mariana Rivera,,margara.sees@gmail.com,C,"I am a not-so-new novice! I was in a full time program called Pursuit briefly studying Swift alongside other students from underrepresented groups in tech, but my work schedule worked very poorly with the workload and so I had to leave that cohort. My favorite part of the short time I was in the iOS group was starting a text-based adventure program using Swift. It gave me the chance to practice what I had learned so far, but also infuse some creativity in the storyline! Being able to infuse some creative choices and get excited  helped me commit to learning what I needed to use in Swift and not stress about the process of learning something new. That said, I'm happy to say I will be returning to Pursuit in June (next month!!) as part of their next Full-Stack cohort. I am excited to get back to work within their community.

Before that and in the interim, I have been studying programming on my own. I am honest in admitting that I am taking it slow! Programming isn't intuitive for me so I have been taking great care to look at different websites and videos in trying to understand anything from data structure concepts to basic problem solving. I have mostly done exercises in Flatiron School's free intro to Javascript online, though I have been dabbling with exercises in Codecademy and freeCodeCamp as well.

Just recently I have started to try to come out of my shell and go to free meetups for women based around code. One was through the group Women Who Code, in which we learned about deploying web apps using Heroku. I am hoping to try and go to more events like this when not at work! I am grateful to live in NYC where there are companies willing to sponsor meetups like this so both students and professional developers (life-long students) can grow and help each other.","I manage a bar part time with bowling! On any given night I work assisting customers, helping the bartender when it's busy, coordinate our bowling leagues, and do some filing. Some of it is not so exciting, but some of it absolutely is. My favorite part of my job is getting to troubleshoot issues on our pinsetters, the machines that place the pins and return bowling balls. Ours are from the 1970s and are very finicky and need great care.","I'm the daughter of Puerto Rican parents and am happy to speak to the importance of having more diversity in tech, whether it is coming from a financial perspective, that of a Latina, or as an ally to others.","In terms of code, my immediate thought goes to my first time within the Pursuit community in which I always tried to own up to my worries and times I needed help in hopes that I was speaking up when maybe others in my same position couldn't. Any time anyone else needed help I would try to advocate as well - just being as open and communicative as possible no matter what the situation. When I've tried to do this, it has been healthy not just for me, but hopefully for others as well, extending beyond situations related to the curriculum and into our personal relationships - I'm not sure if that seems corny or not, but I mean it sincerely. In class coming from a place where I'm not sure what I may be doing rather than helping someone else can be hard, but I try to infuse humor about it to make it easier and I always know deep down that talking about it ends up helping everyone.

At work, I try to be the type of manager that my coworkers feel comfortable offering feedback to - I think being available and offering a safe space for conversations doesn't make you seem weak, but rather makes you stronger. I always make time even if I'm swamped to check in with everyone working just to make sure they know I am looking out for them. I want the work environment to be one in which no one feels like they're just a cog. Even a quick check-in makes for a closer knit community then none at all.

Right now even if I can't always make it to events in person to meet other members of the coding community, I try to follow on social media and have started a blog on Wordpress - to not only learn how to use Wordpress slowly but surely - but also try to start putting in writing what I'm learning and what maybe works or hasn't. My first real post about the Women Who Code event I went to mainly was supposed to be the start of hopefully many times in which there is something basic I don't necessarily understand and the steps I'm taking to work on it. This may sound like it's just about me, but it's not I swear! It comes from a place of hoping that one day, with work, I'll be at a better level with my coding and that someone else with questions and concerns maybe like mine can possibly get some assurance or help when thinking about maybe first lessons to look at or encouragement for going to that first event and meeting people. 

","I didn't know there was a Slack community! I'm not sure how I missed that, but I just registered for an invite! I hope I can be a part of the conversation soon, even if it is just being moral support where I can.

I am relatively new to the CodeNewbie community, having started by listening to some of the podcast episodes, so my involvement so far has mainly been via Twitter - not at my newer handle @tawnyblvd that I created recently to focus on coding, but in my personal one @subtlesunday. I definitely look each week to read about what other newbies are working on, though I have been shy about sharing my own. My goal with my newer Twitter handle is to start posting about both perceived failures and success and reaching out more. It started with the Women Who Code event I went to and I plan to try and keep up! I hope I can interact with the community more on Slack though as I am more comfortable on that platform and am happy to share support as well as try and talk about my troubleshooting with my studies as well.","I am not 100% certain what I would like to do in terms of work, but for now my goal is to keep studying in advance of my going back to the Pursuit program. I know once I am there I will have to be disciplined in terms of timing for my assignments and group projects so I am just doing the best I can to make time for coding so I can have a more seamless transition to being an official student again!

My other short-term code-related goals include:
- going to more coding events, particularly women focused events, and attempting to chat with at least 2 people at each event, even if it is just to say hello! 
- setting aside a whole day to look at the last text adventure Swift program I started and outline how I can improve it. I know I need a good chunk of time to even get started as I have been doing mainly Javascript exercises recently and will be super rusty with my Swift *insert apprehensive face here*

Long term code-related goals include:
- working on a resource mobile app for people looking for healthcare facilities/nursing homes, etc as it is a topic close to my heart
- finding ways while learning to continue to infuse visual, and where applicable, content creativity into coding

I see Codeland as a clear fit in terms of my goals as I am looking to be involved with other junior developers and life-long learners in a positive community like this. It would be great to meet and engage with more people who are coding in person, instead of just online on Slack or Twitter, as much as I am grateful to platforms like those.

The talks and workshops at Codeland, beyond general learning topics, I think would also help me in narrowing down how I could potentially create a healthcare resource like the one I mentioned in my long-term plans. In relation to this, I would look most forward to Luisa Morales' talk on building with accessibility in mind. I haven't looked much yet into accessibility best practices, and yet, with the goals I have for an app it would be entirely remiss for me to create something like this without taking the care to consider accessibility. Being able to take this consideration into practice immediately during the workshop is an inspiring idea to me! I hope I can learn from the experience and put it into practice in my future exercises and projects.","The cost is something I can't spare easily, even with my job. My rent and ConEdison bills don't leave me with much. I think Codeland is important enough in terms of both the content and the community of new and growing developers, that I would find a way to go. I would try to pick up shifts or ask for help some other way as the conference seems like an important step at this point in my experience learning to program. That said, any discount would be helpful. Since I do work I am not asking to pay just $25 as I know the need for others who may not be employed would be greater for that low a ticket price, but I can't afford the regular rate, and am hoping I can possibly budget for any smaller amount. Anything would be helpful! I'm so excited and determined to go no matter what so if there aren't any funds available I will try to figure out how I can ask for help another way and hope that some of my coworkers want shifts off soon. I hope so!",linkedin.com/in/ariwich/,"@tawnyblvd for coding related, @subtlesunday for mostly nonsense/retweets related to Vision Zero/cycling in NYC",I play the glockenspiel as a hobby - does Codeland need a glockenspiel-based jingle?

I wanted to help my community by contributing for their welfare in some small way. So, I started SCIO - a non-profit for increasing awareness of the importance of education and conducted campaigns to reduce the girl child drop-out rate. I went door-to-door to houses in the village to convince the families of the need to continue education. I realized that I could help and empower those girls better by playing an active role in helping them shape their resolve for continued education. I also formed a support group of volunteers willing to spend time on weekends teaching basic math and science to kids. Our team continued to help these kids for over 4 years and SCIO continues even today.

The main barrier is cost. The study guides, the in-class training, the exam vouchers can cost somewhere between $2000 to $10 000. Some of us are fortunate to get these fees covered by their employers but the rest of us only have the option to self-study. Fortunately, there are a lot of resources that are quite affordable to do so. However, obtaining a certification can be a long journey where the certification seeker needs to have the discipline to carve out time to consistently study and not be distracted by other life events. It can be a lonely journey. Secure That Cert! tries to remove as many roadblocks as possible and create a supporting community. Participants to our study groups get their study material mailed to them as soon as they sign up. We start our study group with a detail study and assessment plan. We also make sure that participants who often join us after a long day at work have generous snacks and  refreshments during the evening. So far, we started 2 study groups with a dozen participants in each. Our CompTIA CySA+ study group participants will attend their last session at the end of May. Our ISC2 CCSP study group participants will attend their last study session at the end of June. I am very proud of what we have achieved. This is one of the ways that I contribute to my Infosec community.

I can use my L&D benefit for the conference ticket, however, I would need to pay out of pocket for travel and hotel. I have a few options that I could take:

1. Fly solo and continue to push the full burden of childcare onto my partner. This is how I currently handle things, and I'm actively seeking solutions to reduce the burnout on my partner. This is not a long-term solution for us. We currently do not have budget for child-care beyond pre-school for our youngest child.

2. Fly solo, but have child-care scholarship funds that my partner can use locally in San Francisco. This would bring our family a significant relief

3. Fly with my oldest child (6yo), so that she can partake in onsite child care (or join me?) at Codeland. This would significantly assist my partner, as she'd only have one child to care for for the duration of the conference.

3. Fly with my whole family and both children (6yo, 3yo) both partake in on-site childcare, and my partner gets to have some self-care time. They have been solo for half of May while I've been away for work. I don't expect this to be a viable option since the airfare costs for a family of four are large, and would likely be better allocated to another attendee in need of assistance.

Outside of tech, I teach English and Germany integration techniques for refugees from Gambia  in the community centre next door to me. Their passion and drive for improving their lives in a new place really touches my soul and makes me appreciate my life everytime we meet. Although I also identify as a minority, I have been fortunate enough to learn english growing up which helps in the job seeking/socialising department. I want to share any knowledge I have to make someone elses' life flow better. ",I have been following CodeNewbie twitter and slack for a while now but I have felt a bit too insecure to contribute to it. I plan to change this in the next few weeks though once I have masted a few projects under my belt. ,"My goals are constantly getting iterated at the same rate as I iterate my code. So loosely, they are: 
1. Become a Speaker  at a conference sharing a development problem that I've solved by Dec 2019 - Katrina Owens from Github is my absolute idol, her talk about building instincts in development at Craft conference has really inspired me to take on this challenge. I have a few questions I'd like to ask her in person and hope to catch her at Codeland for her 'How to fail without being a loser' talk. 
2. Write 10 test driven modules to add to our CRM system by  end of July 2019 
3. Become a coach at Rails Girls meetup by June 2020 - Rails girls is always exploring the wonderful things we can do with code, which is aligned with Codeland's philsophy. 
4.  Become the main contributor of technical documentation at my current company - Codeland's simplifies the documentation through blogs and podcasts, I aspire to use these concepts to enhance the understanding of others through 'how to documentations' and also write an onboarding for juniors in joining the company.","As I have been unable to afford a computer science degree, I tried hard to self learn and was lucky enough to gain an unpaid internship position with this company in the hope of moving to a paid position.

S193: Supriya Aggarwal,,aggarwalsupriya47@gmail.com,E,"I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. And I have programmed quite a lot in college. I have written code in C (to build a compiler and to build a packet sniffer), in C++ (just for fun), in Java (professionally), in Python (to build a movie recommender and a rank-based retrieval system) and in R (to build a food rating service and to color monochrome images).
I have interned with Samsung for two months. During the internship, I built a system, using fingerprinting, to determine distance between access¬†
point and wireless device. (Using Java)
I have interned with PayPal for five months. During the internship, I worked on the addition of services to the utility that handles transactions¬†
which are left in the hanging state due to unprecedented reasons. (Using Java)","Currently, I am employed with Apple in India and I am working on enhancing the authentication and authorization services here. I primarily focus on the backend of applications.","I identify as a woman and ever since I joined college, I have felt the gender gap becoming wider. In college, I was a part of various tech organizations/clubs where the trend was to give little to no work to females because males could work with each other in their hostels while females couldn't because of the small numbers. Now at work, the gap continues and when I look at higher management, I can hardly identify any woman.","I have been involved in two such activities which I think are helping me contribute towards empowerment of women in technical fields. The first being that I have been connected with the School Adoption Program of an NGO, Nirmaan Organization, for two years. Being a part of it, I initiated the Computer Literacy Program for school children. In the first few teaching visits, it was evident that boys would find it easier to convince their parents to allow them to attend computer literacy classes. Convincing the parents of girls in to allow their daughters to attend classes after 5PM was a major challenge. In order to tackle this, I decided that we needed to start having our sessions inside the homes of these girls and so, we did, covering around five households initially. Today, I have taught the basics of how a computer is operated, that is operating MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, browsing the Internet, etc., to almost ten girls from the village. This is the start that I feel will enable them to use computers and know about the technology available to them. In addition, the NGO has purchased a laptop specifically for these children. The second such initiative is my contribution to the ACM-W chapter of my college as one of the five founding members in August 2016. One of the biggest challenges of the chapter was to convince women in their freshman year to join the cause, but through dedication, we managed to inspire those youngsters to not only join us, but to develop into worthy successors to our positions of responsibility. The issue of meaningful work being channeled towards the males in any technical team has been nullified in this all women team, ensuring good learning opportunities for the members. I personally serve as a mentor to one of my juniors in college, guiding her through her development as a computer scientist to complement the frequent meets we have with all junior members of the team. I strongly believe that mentoring can really provide the requisite push in the right direction and along with enabling the juniors to learn from my mistakes, it inspires them to make their own, making it a rapid learning process. In addition, I have made a group of five women who I build applications with as and when we get novel ideas. Currently we are working on building an application called ‚ÄòWanderdrobe‚Äô that aims to suggest clothes to take to a user based on his/her travel destination and duration. To wrap it up, we stand to gain a lot by exposing and encouraging young girls, who are interested to follow their hearts and minds, to technical fields because these girls, given the right guidance and resources, will definitely have a lot to offer to the world.",NA,"My brain constantly comes up with new ideas that can be implemented through technology and if done successfully, can become a solution to some grave problems that our society faces today, for example, depression, gender stereotyping, healthcare, crimes, etc. However, in order to execute those ideas, I need to build a certain level of confidence within myself that I am capable of making a difference with the help of technology. I have started to involve myself in open source. I have worked professionally as well. And I hope to come out confident by the end of two years and start building something of my own.


Being at a really early stage in my career (I joined the industry less than a year back), I love exploring new options in the field alongside new technologies. I believe that Codeland will be monumental in introducing to me new avenues in tech and get me excited about trying various options before I settle for something.

Not to mention, it will provide me with the needed motivation to keep growing in tech and help me get involved with developers around the world which in turn, would give me the confidence needed to build something of my own. I will get to hear about experiences and ideas from fellow developers and share mine in return and this, I believe, is what creates a truly global community.","I need this scholarship in order to be able to attend the conference because I am fresh out of college and so don't have enough resources to fund myself.

S198: Alex Gong,Alice Gong,alicegong123@gmail.com,E,"I have experience with website building basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and SQL (Microsoft SQL Server, Teradata), and Python. I‚Äôm really trying to improve on my programming skills because I would like to learn Python for data science. I would say I am basic/intermediate in Python. I definitely a #CodeNewbie and am working hard on leveling up my skills. In the future, I want to learn full-stack Javascript. ","I am a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Supply Chain Management and Information Systems / Information Technology. My major is not as technical as I would like so I am self-teaching myself Python (esp. for data science). This semester, I have taught myself an intermediate level of SQL.  

I took this past semester off from school and interned at United Airlines as an Analytics and Insights Intern under their Global Operations, Strategy and Design division. I have worked on long term projects as well as ad hoc projects. Long term projects include: analyzing 800,000+ rows of data to build datasets and reports for the move team (to determine most used equipment to move airplanes from gate to gate to improve efficiency) and for the catering team (to tie specific food items back to customer satisfaction to improve catering customer satisfaction scores.) I used SQL and Excel to consolidate, aggregate, manipulate and analyze data. I went out of my way to automate ad hoc tasks such as using a dictionary and function to generate an excel document with many of thousands of rows that changed a field each row instead of having to spend hours upon hours doing it manually.  In the past, I have been indecisive about what I wanted to pursue and didn‚Äôt really realize I wanted to learn more coding until this current internship in which I realized that I could have done a lot more if I had came in with a lot more knowledge.","Disabled, LGBTQ, woman","Yes! I am all about community! As a university student who has tried many different activities and student organizations, I have learned that for a student organization to have committed members, it is all about the community of the student organization. One community at school that I have been very invested in is Illini Film and Video. I have been involved in this organization since the beginning of my freshman year of college. I have worked extremely hard at developing a community in this organization. I have been on the executive board of this student organization for most of my time with it. As the treasurer, I applied and received $4000+ in funding as well as created an internal financial constitution.

When I first joined the club, it was quite small but through promoting and fostering a community, I have helped it grow from approximately 15 people to 40-50 people who attend the regular daily meetings. I was also in charge of implementing a Slack group to organize project communications and transparency for the club as well as to help people easily get in contact and get to know other members of the community. Additionally, I worked with the other students to start a film festival for 100 people to display the works of students. That was an important learning experience for me in terms of learning to work efficiently in a team and learning how to create a big event from scratch. I worked on a wide variety of tasks in planning, fundraising, marketing, and the selection of short films.

I have worked on and lead a variety of different short films and promotional projects. My best times in college have been on a film set, working with a team to create short films.","I have only recently discovered CodeNewbie within the last two months but it has been really uplifting and motivating to follow the Twitter and listen to the podcasts. My current twitter is private and I do not have a public twitter (though I should probably make one because I know it‚Äôs a great way to keep in touch and get involved in the computer science community). I do participate and read through the twitter threads as well as regularly listen to the podcast.

I am more involved with the in person coding community in Chicago. Multiple times a week, I go to tech meetups to learn more about coding and data. These tech meetups mostly hosted by Chicago Python (ChiPy) and coding bootcamps and meetup groups in the area.

Additionally, I am working my way through the book Automate the Boring Stuff (for Python) and post my code online on my github. (I know there are solutions already available online but I try to differentiate my code by making it work with many different inputs instead of returning an error and making sure my code is commented out well and easy for some one else to understand.)  ","I am currently learning Python (for fundamentals as well as data science and machine learning) and hope to learn full-stack Javascript in the future. A side project that I hope to start within the next few weeks and complete this summer is a project in which I use web scrapping and machine learning to predict which concerts sell out and how quickly they sell out at Lincoln Hall in Chicago. This is a small concert venue that hosts indie/alternative artists. This venue is unique because it holds all tickets at Will Call (pick up) which means it does not allow resale tickets so if the concert is sold out, there is no way to obtain a ticket off of someone. As a music lover, many of the bands I listen to come to town and perform at this venue. Their concerts get announced months in advance so I often face the conflict of buying a ticket or not  and when to buy the ticket because I do not know if I am busy at that time but also I do not know if the concert will sell out. Many times, the concerts I predict will sell out don‚Äôt but the concerts I do not predict will sell out end up selling out very quickly. Another related project I have in mind is looking at how much are resale prices for concerts for a specific genre (indie/alternative) and how they fluctuate over time. 

Currently, I am facing a dilemma on how I should proceed in college and in learning. Through my current internship, I have realized that I really want more technical skills and would like to go into data science or software engineering. I have currently been at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign for two years and my current majors are Supply Chain Management and Information Systems / Information Technology. My major in college is not as technical as I want it to be. I do not know if I should finish out my college career and then do a bootcamp/Master‚Äôs or just go to a bootcamp instead of going back to school in the fall. (Unfortunately, the transfer process into Computer Science at my school is extremely rigorous and nearly impossible. Many people with 4.0 GPAs and many side projects have unsuccessfully tried to transfer in.) I am hoping Codeland will help me find a mentor or people who have walked the same path as me in terms or trying to get into the coding world but not coming from that background or a traditional route.

Codeland is for CodeNewbies like me and I would really like to connect with other people who are on their journey to learning code and learning by themselves. Even though this year, I‚Äôve been pushing myself to learn how to code, that comes with a lot of fear because I am learning by myself and taking the non-traditional path. Additionally, I have had close friends tell me that I should not pursue computer science and I am not cut out for it. I think I have always wanted more technical skills but was intimated by other people my age who already knew so much more than me. I think Codeland would provide me with the foundation of confidence, knowledge, connections and mentors I need to become a data scientist or a software engineer. 

Codeland is what I need to push me past some of my coding fears as well as figure out how to proceed in my next life steps and learning how to code.",I need this scholarship because I cannot afford the cost of the conference and the cost of a hotel to stay in New York otherwise. ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-gong-193553168/,,,I'm already subscribed.,Conference cost.

S207: Alex Gong,Alice Love Gong,alicegong123@gmail.com,E,"I have experience with website building basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and SQL (within Microsoft SQL Server, Teradata, Palantir), and Python. I‚Äôm really trying to improve on my programming skills because I would like to learn Python for data science. I would say I am basic/intermediate in Python. I definitely a #CodeNewbie and am working hard on leveling up my skills. In the future, I want to learn full-stack Javascript. ","I am a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Supply Chain Management and Information Systems / Information Technology. My major is not as technical as I would like so I am self-teaching myself Python (esp. for data science). This past few months, I have taught myself an intermediate level of SQL.  

I took this past semester off from school and interned at United Airlines as an Analytics and Insights Intern under their Global Operations, Strategy and Design division. I have worked on long term projects as well as ad hoc projects. Long term projects include: analyzing 800,000+ rows of data to build datasets and reports for the move team (to determine most used equipment to move airplanes from gate to gate to improve efficiency) and for the catering team (to tie specific food items back to customer satisfaction to improve catering customer satisfaction scores.) I used SQL and Excel to consolidate, aggregate, manipulate and analyze data. I went out of my way to automate ad hoc tasks such as using a dictionary and function to generate an excel document with many of thousands of rows that changed a field each row instead of having to spend hours upon hours doing it manually.  In the past, I have been indecisive about what I wanted to pursue and did not really realize I wanted to learn more coding until this current internship in which I realized that I could have done a lot more if I had entered the internship with a lot more coding knowledge.","Disabled, LGBTQ, woman","Yes! I am all about community! As a university student who has tried many different activities and student organizations, I have learned that for a student organization to have committed members, it is all about the community of the student organization. One community at school that I have been very invested in is Illini Film and Video. I have been involved in this organization since the beginning of my freshman year of college. I have worked extremely hard at developing a community in this organization. I have been on the executive board of this student organization for most of my time with it. As the treasurer, I applied and received $4000+ in funding as well as created an internal financial constitution.

When I first joined the club, it was quite small but through promoting and fostering a community, I have helped it grow from approximately 15 people to 40-50 people who attend the regular daily meetings. I was also in charge of implementing a Slack group to organize project communications and transparency for the club as well as to help people easily get in contact with and get to know other members of the community. Additionally, I worked with the other executive members to start a film festival for 100 people to display the works of students. That was an important learning experience for me in terms of learning to work efficiently in a team and learning how to create a big event from scratch. I worked on a wide variety of tasks in planning, fundraising, marketing, and the selection of short films.

I have worked on and lead a variety of different short films and promotional projects. My best times in college have been on a film set, working with a team to create short films.","I have only recently discovered CodeNewbie within the last two months, but it has been really uplifting and motivating to follow the Twitter and listen to the podcasts. I do participate and read through the Twitter threads as well as regularly listen to the podcast. My Twitter is private so I am not sure if people can see my responses. I do follow a lot of coders and technologists on Twitter though. I will make a public Twitter soon because I know it‚Äôs a great way to keep in touch and get involved in the community!

I am involved with the in-person coding community in Chicago. Multiple times a week, I go to tech meetups to learn more about coding and data. These tech meetups mostly hosted by Chicago Python (ChiPy) and coding bootcamps and meetup groups in the area. I have met multiple cool and knowledgeable people through these meetups. 

Additionally, I am working my way through the book Automate the Boring Stuff (for Python) and post my code online on my GitHub. (I know there are solutions already available online but I try to differentiate my code by making it work with many different inputs instead of returning an error. I make sure my code is commented out well and is easy for someone else to understand.)  

I have also recently started embarking on my 100 days of code journey and am 18 days into doing project-based coding for an hour a day.","I am currently learning Python (for fundamentals as well as data science and machine learning) and hope to learn full-stack Javascript in the future. A side project that I hope to start within the next few weeks and complete this summer is a project in which I use web scrapping and machine learning to predict which concerts sell out and how quickly they sell out at Lincoln Hall in Chicago. This is a small concert venue which many artists I listen to visit. All tickets sold have to be picked up at the concert in person so if the concert is sold out, there is no way to obtain a ticket off of someone. The concerts are announced months in advance so I often face the internal conflict of buying a ticket or not and when to buy the ticket because I do not know if I am busy at that time but also I do not know if the concert will sell out. Many times, the concerts I predict will sell out do not sell out but the concerts I do not predict will sell out end up selling out very quickly and I miss out on the concert. Another related project I have in mind is looking at how much are resale prices for concerts for a specific genre (indie/alternative) and how they fluctuate over time. 

Currently, I am facing a dilemma on how I should proceed in college and in learning. Through my current internship, I have realized that I really want more technical skills and would like to go into data science or software engineering. I have currently been at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign for two years and my current majors are Supply Chain Management and Information Systems / Information Technology. My major in college is not as technical as I want it to be. I do not know if I should finish out my college career with those majors and then do a bootcamp/Master‚Äôs or just go to a bootcamp instead of going back to school in the fall. (Unfortunately, the transfer process into Computer Science at my school is extremely rigorous and nearly impossible. Many people with 4.0 GPAs and many side projects have unsuccessfully tried to transfer in.) I am hoping Codeland will help me find a mentor to give me advise or connect me with people who have walked the same path as me in terms or trying to get into the coding world but not coming from that background or from a traditional route.

Codeland is for CodeNewbies like me and I would really like to connect with other people who are on their journey to learning code and learning by themselves. Even though this year, I have been pushing myself to learn how to code, that comes with a lot of fear because I am learning by myself and taking the non-traditional path. I want to have a support system in this journey. I have had close friends tell me that I should not pursue computer science and I am not cut out for it and I am working hard to prove them wrong. I think I have always wanted more technical skills but was too intimated by other people my age who already knew so much more than me to reach for my dreams. I think Codeland would provide me with the foundation of confidence, knowledge, connections and mentors I need to become a data scientist or a software engineer. 

Codeland is what I need to push me past some of my coding fears as well as figure out how to proceed in my next life steps and learning how to code.",I need this scholarship because I cannot afford the cost of the conference and the cost of a place to stay otherwise. ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-gong-193553168/,,Already submitted an application earlier today; I just updated some of the responses a bit. ,I'm already subscribed.,Conference cost.

S208: Parul Aggarwal,Parul Aggarwal,parulagg27@gmail.com,E,"I'm a self-taught programmer and originally was a medical aspirant. I started learning to program 1.7 years back with no prior experience in the Computer Science field. Taking motivation from my college seniors, I began with C and then C++, learning OOPs and functional programming concepts. From there, my interest grew towards learning python and web development and I also got familiar with the concept of open source development and have been admiring it since then. I'm passionately curious individual and always strive to keep my basics strong and crystal clear. I've so far worked with several python libraries and frameworks such as NumPy, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Flask, etc. and have also worked on some projects based on them.",I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate student pursuing my bachelor's degree in Information Technology,Delhi,"I strongly feel that community building and upkeep is one of the most rewarding activities, especially in a field like technology, where it really helps you stay updated with all the changes in the Dev world and get connected to people around who‚Äôve got your back.
All the things that I‚Äôve learned and achieved till date wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the help from the members of the communities that I‚Äôm a part of. 

When I started learning to program 1.7 years back, I joined the core team of a technical community in my college, named as Google Developers Group (now known as Google Developers Student Club) and Women Techmakers chapter in my college. I initially served these two communities in non-technical ways, by helping them in organizing offline coding classes and meetups like I/O Extended and providing them outreach support to get more students in colleges involved with them. 
By working closely with them and attending their basic coding sessions, I started gaining more clarity in this field and gained the confidence to explore more areas on my own. When I gained some experience with python programming and web development, I started serving them as a web developer and contributed in multiple ways. One of my major contributions was developing the algorithm for the leaderboard on their challenge series website (dscbvp.tech/#/challenges). I also served them as one of the mentors in their mentorship program and mentored 11 students closely and taught them basics of programming in python, dual booting, linux OS, git and basics of web development, conducting classes almost every week since September 2018. All these contributions helped me as well in improving my public speaking skills and I discovered a new interest within me, the interest towards helping others learn through my knowledge.

I‚Äôm also a part of Delhi chapter of Facebook Developers Circle which is now a strong community of 11,000+ developers across Delhi NCR. As a newbie, I realized how difficult it gets to ask for help since many-a-times I ended up with a thought that my question might sound stupid and I‚Äôll be backfired by experienced folks. After realizing that this is a problem faced by many newbies, I started and led an initiative under them, where members could ask questions anonymously through a form and I used to validate and then post them as github issues in their repo (github.com/facebook-developer-circle-delhi/Ask-The-Community) and share their link in the facebook group. Other community members then answers them to the best of their knowledge and this ultimately helped that person getting their doubts answered without any fear.
I always enjoy working with and for the community and look forward to contributing more in other meaningful ways.","I‚Äôm pretty much new to the CodeNewbie community and got to know about it recently through a newsletter where I also got to know about the codeland conference. Hence, I didn‚Äôt get to involve much with the community. 

Although I‚Äôm actively following tweets by the community and learning a lot from them side by side, I‚Äôm unaware of any existing slack channel by this community and would really love to join it. It would be really helpful if I could get an invite to join the same and could connect with other members of the community.","I'm in my early stages of building my career in coding field and there are still so many domains for me that are yet to be explored and learnt from. So, attending the Codeland will help me get a wider perspective of this field and develop new interests and contribute more.  
Despite of being a self-taught programmer, I still feel a need of having a mentor alongside who'll help me learn a difficult concept in person and fill my knowledge gaps the way it used to happen in our school times. Recently, I developed a curiosity to learn more about web extensions and addons, and develop one on my own. But, I always find it intimidating to start with and fail to find relevant resources. I also do not have any mentor in my network yet no one amongst my peers who could help me in person regarding the same. So, attending this conference will help me feed this curiosity, find a mentor and get a hands-on experience so that I can finally start with building my own web extensions. 
Being a women in tech, I find it difficult sometimes to work in this male-dominant field and prove my knowledge and worth every-time. Hence,  I started following so many awesome female developers across the globe on twitter who are inspiring others through their knowledge, skills and projects. Ali Spittel and Katrina Owen are one of those badass developers whom I look up to everytime I feel low or less motivated. Ali being an amazing teacher who is helping community in multiple ways, including office hours and Katrina, the founder of Excercism platform and engineer at GitHub, both of them inspires me a lot. It would be one of the greatest yet a rare opportunity for me, if I could meet them in person and get mentored by them directly.","I hail from a family with a low economic background and my parents are also currently in debt to help me and my other two siblings pursue our education successfully and keep things going smoothly. So, it'd be really helpful to me both personally and professionally, if these expenses of mine could be covered and I get a chance to attend the conference and learn from my fellow developers across the globe.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/parulagg27/,https://twitter.com/parulagg27,,Yes,"Ticket, flight and hotel","Delhi, India","I got to know about this scholarship through a news letter, Diversify Tech by Veni Kunche.
